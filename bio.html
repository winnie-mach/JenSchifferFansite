        </blockquote>
        <p>Jenn Schiffer started as a Computer Science major at Montclair State University. After graduating and receiving her bachelor’s for Computer Science in 2007, she went for her for a Master’s Degree in Computer the following school year.</p><br>
        <p> She considers herself a programmer and an artist and uses her programming skills to create her highly recognisable pixel art, that is, art in the style of 8 bit pixels built with code, with a focus on women and erotica.</p><br>
        <p>She has mentioned that she would not be where she is today as a programmer and artist if it wasn’t for a project she started around 2016 called <a href="https://make8bitart.com/">make8bitart.com</a>. Make8bitart.com is an open source in-browser application built to draw pixel art and has so far at the end of 2017, managed to have 348,071 enter the site and 1,318 days and 12 hours total time spent by all users.</p><br>
        <p>She is currently working for <a href="http://www.fogcreek.com/">Fog Creek Software</a> as a Community Engineer on a project called <a href="https://glitch.com/">Glitch</a> which is a cool in-browser IDE built around the idea of an inclusive community of coders and learners.</p><br>
        <p>She is also a satirical tech blogger and has contributed a large amount of written work in the form of blogs to the community. Check out her blogs on <a href="https://medium.com/@jennschiffer">Medium</a>.</p><br>
        <p>She organises a meet up called Jersey Script, basically a front end developer social meet up that happens every last Tuesday of each month at 7am. Location is at the Barcade JC per below if you feel like flying over to the US right now: </p>
